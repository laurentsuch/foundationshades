## Purpose of this project: 
As an avid makeup consumer, I realized much of the brands I was purchasing from did not carry colors that catered towards women of color. This project hopes to shed light on the lack of foundation shades for ethnic/people of color, especially from large makeup conglomerates. 

## Description: 
From Kaggle, I used and manipulated a public database of makeup (foundation) products, with their corresponding product names, brand names, hex codes (color codes), HSV values, and lightness values. Much of the color matching from swatches of makeup were appointed through CIELAB color lab to find and attribute these values to their corresponding products. With added products and changing product lines, updates to this project is much needed. 

### About HSV and L values:

HSV stands for Hue - Saturation - Value. 

Hue is represented with an angle (0 to 360 degrees), with the following correspondants: 

0-60	Red
60-120	Yellow
120-180	Green
180-240	Cyan
240-300	Blue
300-360	Magenta


Saturation indicates how much 'gray' is in the space. When 0, the color is gray and when 1.0 the color is a primary color. 

Value records the brightness of color. When 0, the color is black, when 1.0, the color is white (Scale is 0-100 or 0 - 1.0).
